## Overview

I am a passionate programmer based in Japan, with a focus on Next.js and web development. I am actively involved in developing web applications, websites, e-commerce platforms, and databases. Recently, I have also started delving into CLI and framework development.

## Journey So Far

<Steps>

### 2009

I was born on August 14th this year.

### 2010 ~ 2015

During this period, I didn't have any specific professions or hobbies, but I enjoyed playing with LEGO blocks.

### 2016 ~ 2019

I began to take an interest in carpentry and enjoyed creating things.

### 2020 ~ 2022

The internet became more accessible, and I encountered programming. I was creating programs by combining blocks, similar to Scratch.

### 2023

I started self-learning programming languages like HTML and CSS, marking the beginning of my programming journey.

### 2024

In about a year, I gained enough skills to teach programming. I started building websites using technologies like Next.js and TypeScript, accelerating my learning pace.
